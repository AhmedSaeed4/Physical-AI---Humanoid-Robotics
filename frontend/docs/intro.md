# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

This comprehensive guide bridges modern generative AI with hard robotics, focusing on humanoid robots using NVIDIA's ecosystem. You'll learn to build intelligent robots that can understand natural language commands, navigate complex environments, and interact with the physical world using Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## What You'll Learn

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book is structured into 6 parts across 12 chapters:

1. **Infrastructure** - Hardware setup, OS configuration, and development environment
2. **ROS Fundamentals** - Robot Operating System architecture and communication patterns
3. **Simulation** - Physics simulation with Gazebo and photorealistic environments with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
4. **Perception** - Sensor integration, SLAM, and navigation systems
5. **AI Integration** - Voice processing, LLM action planning, and VLA systems
6. **Capstone Project** - Complete "Butler Test" implementation

## The Complete Stack

This book covers the entire technology stack from hardware to AI:
- **Hardware**: Ubuntu 22.04, NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti+, Unitree Go2/G1 robots
- **Middleware**: ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill with custom interfaces
- **Simulation**: Gazebo physics and NVIDIA Isaac Sim 4.0+
- **AI**: OpenAI Whisper/GPT-4o APIs with local alternatives
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with GPU acceleration

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux/Ubuntu environments
- Familiarity with Git and version control
- Access to NVIDIA GPU hardware (RTX 4070 Ti or better recommended)

## Getting Started

The book follows a "Sim-to-Real" approach where you'll first master concepts in simulation before deploying on real hardware. Each chapter builds upon the previous, culminating in a complete humanoid robot system capable of executing complex tasks like "Go to the kitchen and find the red mug."

## The Butler Test

By the end of this book, you'll have implemented the complete "Butler Test" scenario:
1. Process natural language commands through voice input
2. Plan navigation paths through complex environments
3. Use VLA systems to identify and interact with specific objects
4. Execute coordinated humanoid robot behaviors
